            <div class="title2">The summoned ones</div>
            <div class="text">One of the forces left behind by Jeffrey is a force that summons people from a world with more advanced technology but without magic. These people usually have the ability of growth that only a few people in the world has. This is usually done as a way to balance the forces of evil and good when someone with a lot of power starts trying to corrupt the world so that it becomes a terrible place to live in.</div>
            <div class="title2">The first summoned ones</div>  
            <div class="text">The first ones to be summoned and the comming generations of summoned ones were summoned by Jeffrey themself, due to Jeffrey still being in one piece at that time. They were not only summoned to bring to end a tyrant who started to raid villages and keep the survivors as slaves, but also to bring together towns to start forming a kingdom that were to support it's people and the summoned ones that were to come. This lead to the royal and noble families to hail from some of the first ever heroes to be summoned and they've used this both as a reason why they're the ones in power, and as a moral compass to honor their heritage. For if they fail to do so then they are stripped of their power and banished to the very dungeons that they themselves use to keep criminals.</div>
